       <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Dengler and I am in my second quarter of the Web Development Certification program</p>
       <p>Within my Portal Page, you will find links to my projects and the application of what I've learned so far. </p>
       <p>I am looking forward this quarter to working on my CSS skills to make my websites more visually appealing.</p>
       <p>I currently work as a bartender at a pinball bar in Greenwood in addition to being a full time student. Feel free to stop by, grab a brew, and say hello!</p>
